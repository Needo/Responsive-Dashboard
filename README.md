## Barebones Branch

This branch has the minimum tools and code included use the dashboard. It contains the basic HTML and CSS required, with no JavaScript functionality or build tools (NodeJS, Bower & Gulp).

### What's missing?

1. Sidebar toggle functionality: A toggle of the `active` class on the `#page-wrapper` div.
2. Bootstrap [dropdown](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns) toggle functionality.
3. Sidebar cookie state: Once the sidemenu has been toggled, to persist the same state on a page reload, a cookie state needs to be set.
